# 🦆 Rubber Duck Mafia

Welcome to **Rubber Duck Mafia** — where questionable decisions meet impeccable debugging.

## 🧠 About Us
We're an organization built on a simple truth: **every great developer secretly works for a rubber duck**. Some confess it. Some deny it. We embrace it.

Our mission is to:
- Write code so clean it makes a duck cry.
- Ship features with the precision of a mobster making *"problems disappear"*.
- Debug like absolute lunatics talking to small plastic birds.

## 💼 What We Do
"Business." Not the IRS-kind. The developer-kind.
- Open-source tools
- Developer productivity experiments
- Frameworks your team is *pretty sure* don’t need—but will love anyway
- Libraries that either solve your biggest problem or create three smaller ones (we're still measuring)

## 🦆 Our Code of Honor
1. **Never debug alone.** Bring a duck.
2. **Every commit message must strike fear or laughter. Preferably both.**
3. **Refactor like you’re cleaning up after the... family.**
4. **If it works, don’t question it.** If it doesn't work, also don’t question it—ask the duck.

## 💣 Our Style
Smart. Funny. Slightly threatening. The perfect brand for devs who:
- Write code at 3 AM
- Believe rubber ducks have mystical powers
- Want their GitHub org to look like it runs a digital crime syndicate

## 🫡 Join the Family
If you're here, you're already one of us.

Just remember:

### **Talk to the duck… or sleep with the bugs.**
